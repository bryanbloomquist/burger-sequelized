# Burger 2: The Sequel

[Deployed App](https://eater-of-burgers-sequel.herokuapp.com/)

### Overview

This homework assignment is **optional**.

In this assignment, you're going to Sequelize the `Burger` app you made last unit. We've split this exercise into three different tiers, all with different tasks and expectations. Finish whichever tier will provide you with the most reasonable challenge.

#### Tier 1: Sequelized! (Basic to Moderate)
## Completed

* Remove all references to your vanilla MySQL queries and replace them with Sequelize queries.

#### Tier 2: Customer Associations (Challenge)
## Not Completed
### (Attempted, Commented Out)

* Add in a Customer association to the project. This will involve creating at least one new Customer model and connecting it with your Burger model.

* If you do go select this tier, you must edit the handlebars files and CSS stylesheets to implement some sort of additional feature to the site. We don't want you to just connect two models and submit your project. Make your site do something relevant to this association.

#### Bonus! (Challenge)
## Completed

* Add validations to your models where:

  * A burger's name cannot be null
  * A burger's devoured status is false by default
  * Order the Burgers you send back to the user in alphabetical order using the Sequelize "order" option.
